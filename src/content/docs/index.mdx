<Card title="What is Orcfax?">[Orcfax](https://orcfax.io) is a blockchain [oracle](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-blockchain-oracle-and-how-does-it-work). It collects and validates data about the real-world and then formats and publishes that data for use by smart contracts on the [Cardano](https://cardano.org) blockchain network. Orcfax is a collection of software components designed to address the [oracle problem](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2524524192?sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals).</Card>

<Card title="What is the Orcfax domain model?">Orcfax is developed using [domain driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) concepts and practices which focuses on the subject area to which the software is applied. A clear [domain model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model) is created as part of this methodology and it is the purpose of this website to define the Orcfax domain.</Card>

<Card title="What is a domain model good for?">This [Orcfax domain model](glossary/intro) is a series of abstractions that describe aspects of the Orcfax domain and can be used to solve problems related to Orcfax design, maintenance, and upgrades.</Card>
