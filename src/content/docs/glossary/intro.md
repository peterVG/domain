description: Introduction to the Orcfax domain glossary

Orcfax is a collection of software components designed to address the oracle problem on the [Cardano](https://cardano.org) blockchain network. Orcfax is a blockchain [oracle](https://docs.orcfax.io/oracle-basics#what-is-an-oracle).

Orcfax is developed using [domain driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) concepts and practices which focuses on the subject area to which the software is applied. A clear domain model is created. That is the purpose of this website.

This domain model is a series of abstractions that describe aspects of the Orcfax domain and can be used to solve problems related to Orcfax design, maintenance, and upgrades.

A key aspect of a domain model is the --ubiquitious language-- or **glossary** which is the shared terminology used by domain experts, software developers and end-users. This glossary is intended to clarify and dissambiguate the relationships and roles of entities that exist within the Orcfax domain.

## Sub-Domains

The Orcfax domain and glossary terms sit at the cross sections of the following domains:
- epistemology / metaphysics
- archival science / records management
- software engineering
- distributed computing / blockchain technology
- Cardano network (proof-of-stake / eUTXO)
- Arweave network (proof-of-storage / endowments)
