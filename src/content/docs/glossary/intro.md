description: Introduction to the Orcfax domain glossary
---

Orcfax is a collection of software components designed to address the oracle problem on the Cardano blockchain network. Orcfax is a blockchain [oracle](https://docs.orcfax.io/oracle-basics#what-is-an-oracle).

This glossary is intended to clarify and dissambiguate the relationships and roles of entities that exist within the Orcfax domain.

Orcfax is developed using [domain driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) concepts and practices which focuses on the subject area to which the software is applied. A clear domain model is created. This is a series of abstractions that describe aspects of the domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.



These aspects of domain-driven design aim to foster a common language shared by domain experts, users, and developersâ€”the ubiquitous language. 

The ubiquitous language is used in the domain model and for describing system requirements.


## Sub-Domains

The Orcfax domain sits at the cross sections of the following domains:
- archival science / records management
